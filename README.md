Goal:

explore an email system that cherrypicks machine-processable emails, and
forwards the others.


Credit/blame:

This code is derived from a fork of pilif/tempalias, but by the time i'm
done it should have no overlap in functionality with that project
-- I'm just using it as a starting point that already does node/redis/forwarding.

Thanks to pilif for the code & inspiration, but don't blame him for my bugs.
